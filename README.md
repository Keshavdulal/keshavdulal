<!-- I am a keen modern-day youth with a degree in Computer Science Engineering and a passionate digital content creator. -->

<!-- I have over 2 years of experience of developing large-scale real-world applications for American Health Care Industries using technologies like in React, Node, Python, Django & PostgreSQL while working fulltime at  [Leapfrog Technology](https://www.lftechnology.com) between 2016-2018. -->

<!-- To summariz my learning experience as a web developer is to understanding the problem and finding solutions while communicating actively with team and client. -->

<!-- During 2018-2020, I tried to find my own path and took a deep dive into the world of digital content creation, travel while living like a digital nomad and running a series of businesses one after another. It didnâ€™t go as planned but I certainly learned a lot of things that I couldnâ€™t have otherwise sitting on the desk. I canâ€™t just summarize them all here. Perhaps over a coffee someday when social-distancing becomes a thing of a past. Coming to COVID, it certainly has given me a push to resume development actively without letting go of my creative pursuits in digital content creation, and I am looking forward to merge all these horizons Iâ€™ve seen and learnt from, together to forge something new. -->

<!-- In my works, I try to draw perspectives from so many different yet intriguing areas such of Software Development, Technology, Human behaviour, Psychology, Digital Content Creation & Consumption, Minimalism & Essentialism, Nature, Travel and so many other avenues of life-experiences. I am driven by this zeal of creating something meaningful and timeless. -->

<!-- I am currently based on Kathmandu, Nepal. However, sometimes you might find me hiking around the foothills of Himalayas. I love trekking, reading books, coffee, colours, conversation and adventure. I certainly donâ€™t mind relocation in a Post-COVID world however Remote-work is the way to go now. -->
