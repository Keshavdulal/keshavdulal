# Hi, I'm Keshav ðŸ‘‹

> Software Engineer / Digital Content Creator

> Actively Looking for [Work Oppurtunities](mailto:keshav.dulal@gmail.com)

I am a keen modern day youth with a degree in Computer Science Engineering and a passionate digital content creater.

I have over 2 years experience of developing large-scale real-world applications for American Health Care Industries using technologies like in React, Node, Python, Django & PostGreSQL while working fulltime at [Leapfrog Technology](https://www.lftechnology.com) between 2016-2018.
<!-- To summariz my learning experience as a web developer is to understanding the problem and finding solutions while communicating actively with team and client. -->

During 2018-2020, I tried to find my own path and took a deep dive into the world of digital content creation, travel while living like a digital nomad and running a series of businesses one after another. It didn't go as planned but I certainly learned a lot of things that I couldn't have otherwise sitting on desk. I can't just summarize them all here. Perphaps over a coffee someday when social-distancing becomes a thing of a past. Coming to Covid, it certainly has given me a push to resume development actively without letting go of my creative pursuits in digital content creation, and I am loking forward to merge all these horizons I've seen and learnt from, together to forge something new.

In my works, I try to draw perspectives from so many different yet intriguing areas such of Software Development, Technology, Human behaviour, Psycology, Digital Content Creation & Consumption, Minimalism & Essentialism, Nature, Travel and so many other avenues of life-experiences. I am driven by this zeal of creating something meaningful and timeless.

I am currently based on Kathmandu, Nepal. However sometimes you might find me hiking around the foothills of himalayas. I love trekking, reading books, coffee, colors, conversation and adventure. I certainly don't mind relocation in a Post-Covid world however Remote-work is the way to go now.
